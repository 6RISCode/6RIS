# 6RIS
**The respository of 6RIS, an IPv6 address correlation model based on the joint Representation of Interaction and Sequential behavior for correlation attacks.**

## Requirements
* Python 3.7
* Torch 1.8.1
* Scikit-learn
* ipaddress
* numpy 1.21.5

# Quickstart
6RIS consists of two commandsï¼š
1. Data preparation

Process the data into the format of *data_demo.json*, which contains data with two addresses.

2. Load pre trained model for IPv6 address correlation

```
$ python run.py
```
